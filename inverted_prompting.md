# Inverted Prompting

In contrast to traditional interaction, this approach reverses the process, having the LLM lead the conversation through questions. The goal is to help the person reflect and arrive at the desired solution or objective on their own. Therefore, it offers an important benefit: instead of simply providing ready-made answers, it encourages the development of critical thinking and the ability to solve problems autonomously.
To apply this type of prompt, it is essential to provide a few key elements: a clear and objective context, a well-defined final goal, the format of the questions that will be asked, and the purpose behind these questions.
Here is an example (you can also highlight the elements mentioned above in more complex scenarios):

Imagine you work as a data analyst at a company that offers an online task management tool with various features, such as creating lists, assigning tasks, notifications, and reports. The product team wants to better understand how users are utilizing these features to improve usage and engagement.
Your goal is to analyze how users interact with the tool's features, which ones are most used, and how they complement each other in users' workflows. You have data available such as the frequency of use of each feature, the average time spent on each resource, the number of tasks created and completed, the use of notifications, among others. There is also an interest in identifying underutilized features that can be improved or promoted.
The goal is to identify which features have the greatest impact on users' productivity and which are being underused. Based on this, propose optimizations, design adjustments, or campaigns to increase the use of key features, as well as explore product improvements based on observed usage patterns.
Example questions:
- How can you segment users based on their use of features to gain a clearer view of different behavior patterns?
- What do the available data suggest about the adoption flow of features over time? Are there specific patterns that you should explore more deeply?
- What type of analysis could help understand the relationship between feature usage and the objective the product team wants to achieve?
